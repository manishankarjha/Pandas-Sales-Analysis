# Pandas-Sales-Analysis

### Intro

We have been given Sales data of each month of year 2019 in ``Sales_data.csv``. In the ``Complete_procedure.py`` file, I have shown all the steps in going through this analysis along with the errors and ways to correct them. For a brief review, we could look at ``Sales_Analysis.py`` where everything is concise and clear.

**Tasks**

- Merged different months sales data into a single ``all_data.csv`` file and augment new DataFrame with additional required columns
- Cleaned Data by eliminating NaN value rows or any other discrepancy


**Project Achievements**

- Keeping pace with demands by finding best City and best month for Sales and ensuring continuous product supply at right time & place
- Reduced company costs by finding most suitable time for displaying advertisements
- Improved Sales by giving offers to customers on product combos most often sold together
